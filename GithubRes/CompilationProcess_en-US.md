# Build Process

For general build requirements, you only need to build `智绘教.vcxproj`. There is an associated project, `PptCOM.csproj`, which serves as the PPT integration module for 智绘教Inkeys.  
The `智绘教.vcxproj` project depends on the library (dll/tlb) generated by `PptCOM.csproj`, but `PptCOM.csproj` has already been built, so you can directly build `智绘教.vcxproj`. This means that only a C++ desktop environment is needed; there's no need to set up a C# environment.
Note: If you only need to build `智绘教.vcxproj`, you should uncheck `PptCOM` under `Solution Configuration->Project dependencies->智绘教`

### Build the Main Project `智绘教.vcxproj`
智绘教Inkeys is completely open-source, with all source code and resources available.

#### Environment Preparation
- Visual Studio 2022 (MSVC v143 compiler)  
  > Check the `C++ Desktop Development` and `Windows Application Development` workloads
- Windows 11 SDK 10.26100

#### Code Environment
- Unicode
- C++20

#### Build Steps
1. Clone the `main` repository
2. Open `智绘教.sln` with Visual Studio 2022
3. Select the `智绘教` project
4. Switch to the `Release | Win32` build configuration (adjust the target architecture as needed, e.g., `x64`)
5. Click `Build -> Build 智绘教` to start building

### Build the Subsidiary Project `PptCOM.csproj`

#### Environment Preparation
- Visual Studio 2022  
  > Check the `.NET Desktop Development` workload
- .NET Framework 4.0 SDK or higher

#### Build Steps
1. Clone the `main` repository
2. Open `智绘教.sln` with Visual Studio 2022
3. Select the `PptCOM` project
4. Switch to `Release | AnyCPU`
5. Click `Build -> Build PptCOM` to build
