### III. Privacy Policy

We respect and protect the personal privacy rights of all users of the Software. We are committed to minimizing data collection and processing information only to the extent necessary to achieve essential functions and improve services, in compliance with applicable data protection laws.

**Unless otherwise stated in these Terms or a separately published Privacy Policy, the core functions of the Software are performed primarily on your local device. We do not proactively read, upload, or store personal sensitive information related to the content of your creations.**

> In the event of any inconsistency between these Terms and the Privacy Policy updated and published separately by Us from time to time, the latest published Privacy Policy shall prevail.

#### 1. Information We Collect and How We Use It

To improve product functionality, perform software updates, and provide technical support, We may collect and process the following information within the **minimum necessary scope**. We will not use it for purposes unrelated to the Software.

| Information Name | Purpose of Collection | Collection and Processing Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IP Information** and **Desktop OS Information (e.g., OS version, locale)** | 1. To determine compatibility and software update strategies for different regions and system versions;<br>2. To understand the system distribution of the user base for planning future development and optimization. | Automatically captured and recorded via network requests when you check for updates or access Our update servers. We focus on statistical analysis and will not attempt to directly link this to personally identifiable information. |
| **Unique User ID (User ID)** | 1. To accurately count active users and avoid duplicate counting;<br>2. To correlate configuration statistics, crash statistics, etc., where necessary, to improve the product. | We generate a **GUID locally on your device** by obtaining hardware information such as motherboard UUID and CPUID, and use the **SHA256 hash** of it as the User ID. This identifier is designed not to contain direct identification information such as your name or account, and We will not attempt to reverse engineer your real identity based on this identifier. |
| **Software Settings Status (e.g., feature toggles, preferences)** | 1. To evaluate the overall usage of various functions to guide future functional adjustments and optimizations;<br>2. To provide more reasonable default settings and experiences for different user groups. | We may statistically analyze the status of certain settings in the Software (e.g., whether a function is enabled) and associate it with the User ID anonymously for overall analysis. The default values of some settings may refer to your system settings (e.g., system language, theme color); this reading operation is performed locally only, and We will not upload the raw details of your system settings. |

**We will not use the above information for automated decision-making or user profiling, nor will we use it for cross-site or cross-service tracking.**

#### 2. Telemetry and Error Reporting (User Initiated)

When the Software crashes or encounters a serious error, the Software may generate an error report on your local device to assist in analyzing the problem. We handle such data based on the principle of **completely voluntary and explicit consent**:

- **Error reports are not uploaded automatically.**  
  We will only receive relevant information when you are explicitly aware of it and **choose to send it proactively**.
- Before clicking "Send," you can usually view or locate the error report file; We recommend that you check it yourself before sending to ensure it does not contain sensitive content you do not wish to share.
- Depending on the specific error type, the error report may contain the following information (content may vary):
  - **System Configuration Information**: e.g., CPU info, graphics card info, memory info, screen parameters (e.g., resolution, refresh rate, EDID, etc.);
  - **Software Logs and Memory Dump Files**: Used to analyze the internal state of the program when the crash occurred;
  - **Relevant Process Information (e.g., process name, basic process info)**: Used to troubleshoot compatibility issues with other processes.

**Our sole purpose in receiving such error reports is to locate and fix issues and improve the stability and performance of the Software.**  
Unless required to meet mandatory legal or regulatory requirements, or necessary to protect the significant legitimate rights and interests of you or others, We will not use error reports for purposes unrelated to failure analysis.

#### 3. Localization and Content Data

We specifically declare and promise:

1. The main functions of the Software (including screen annotation, drawing, screenshot processing, etc.) run on your local device.  

2. Any content created or processed by you during use, including but not limited to:

   - Screenshots;
   - Annotation content (text, graphics, handwriting, etc.);
   - Canvas files or project files;
   - Materials displayed by you during teaching, presentation, or creative activities,
   are stored by default **only on your local device or storage locations of your choice (e.g., local disks, third-party cloud drives configured by you)**.

3. We will not access, collect, or upload the above content through backdoors or hidden functions of the Software, nor will We transfer content stored locally by you to Our servers without your explicit consent.

4. If future versions add functions such as online synchronization, cloud backup, or online collaboration, We will inform you of the types of data to be collected and processed in a conspicuous manner **before you enable the relevant functions** and obtain your separate consent.

#### 4. Data Storage, Cross-Border Transfer, and Security

1. **Data Storage Location**

   1.1 Under the current product design, the Software and related online services are primarily provided to users located **within the territory of the People's Republic of China (PRC)**. We primarily store limited telemetry statistical data and error reports proactively sent by you on servers located **within the PRC**.  

   1.2 We may use third-party service providers (e.g., code hosting platforms, log or error tracking services) to assist Us in processing the above data. We select service providers that operate servers **within the PRC** and comply with legal and regulatory requirements to process data related to the Software; under the current business architecture, this data will not be transferred to or stored on overseas servers.  

   1.3 If cross-border data transfer becomes necessary due to business development or compliance requirements in the future, We will fully inform you of the relevant purpose, data type, recipient, and protection measures in advance within the scope required by applicable law, and proceed only after obtaining necessary authorization or fulfilling statutory procedures.

2. **Data Encryption and Security Measures**

   2.1 During transmission, We will use industry-standard security measures (e.g., TLS/HTTPS) to the extent possible to protect data from unauthorized access or tampering.  

   2.2 During storage, We will take technical and management measures within a reasonable scope to prevent data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or loss.  

   2.3 Although We have made reasonable efforts to improve security, data transmitted over the Internet and stored electronically **cannot be guaranteed to be absolutely secure**. You understand and accept the inherent risks associated with the Internet.

3. **Data Retention Period**

   3.1 We generally retain your relevant data only for the shortest period necessary to achieve the purposes stated in these Terms.  

   3.2 When the data is no longer necessary for the stated purposes, or when the law no longer requires Us to retain it, We will delete, anonymize, or otherwise handle such data in accordance with applicable laws.

4. **Data Sharing and Disclosure**

   We may share or disclose data in the following circumstances, provided it complies with legal and regulatory requirements and is within a necessary and reasonable scope:
